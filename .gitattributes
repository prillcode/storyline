# Line ending normalization

# Shell scripts should always have LF endings (Unix-style)
*.sh text eol=lf
install.sh text eol=lf
remote-install.sh text eol=lf

# PowerShell scripts: stored as-is with CRLF (no conversion)
# Treat as binary to prevent any line ending conversion
*.ps1 binary

# Markdown and YAML files use LF
*.md text eol=lf
*.yaml text eol=lf
*.yml text eol=lf

# Let Git handle these automatically
* text=auto
