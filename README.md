# Storyline

**Story-driven development workflow for Claude Code**

Transform PRDs and technical specs into working code through a structured pipeline: **Epic → Story → Spec → Implementation**

---

## What is Storyline?

Storyline is a CLI toolkit for Claude Code that implements a complete story-driven development workflow. It bridges the gap between product requirements and working code through clear, traceable steps.

**The Pipeline:**

```
PRD/Tech Spec → Epics → User Stories → Technical Specs → Implementation
     ↓            ↓         ↓              ↓                ↓
[epic-creator] [story] [spec-story]  [dev-story]    [create-plans]
```

Each step produces structured markdown files that feed into the next stage, creating full traceability from original requirements to shipped code.

## Features

- **📝 Epic Creation** - Parse PRDs/tech specs into manageable epics
- **📖 Story Generation** - Convert epics into detailed user stories
- **🔧 Spec Creation** - Transform stories into technical specifications
- **⚡ Auto Implementation** - Execute specs using Claude's autonomous planning system
- **🔗 Full Traceability** - Track from requirement → epic → story → spec → code
- **📦 Git Integration** - Automatic commits with proper attribution
- **🎯 Quality Control** - Built-in validation at each stage

## Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prillcode/storyline.git
cd storyline
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The installer will:
1. Check for dependencies (taches-cc-resources)
2. Offer to install dependencies if missing
3. Copy skills and commands to `~/.claude/`

### Manual Install

```bash
# Install taches-cc-resources first (required dependency)
git clone https://github.com/glittercowboy/taches-cc-resources.git
cd taches-cc-resources
cp -r skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
cd ..

# Install storyline
git clone https://github.com/prillcode/storyline.git
cd storyline
cp -r skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
```

### Verify Installation

Start a new Claude Code session and try:
```
/epic-creator --help
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Your PRD

```markdown
# Product Requirements: Task Manager

## Overview
Build a simple task management application...

## Core Features
- User authentication
- Task CRUD operations
- Task categorization
- Due date tracking
```

### 2. Generate Epics

```bash
/epic-creator docs/PRD.md
```

Creates:
```
.workflow/epics/
├── epic-001-authentication.md
├── epic-002-task-management.md
└── epic-003-categories.md
```

### 3. Create Stories from Epic

```bash
/story-creator .workflow/epics/epic-001-authentication.md
```

Creates:
```
.workflow/stories/
├── story-001-user-signup.md
├── story-002-user-login.md
└── story-003-password-reset.md
```

### 4. Generate Technical Spec

```bash
/spec-story .workflow/stories/story-001-user-signup.md
```

Creates:
```
.workflow/specs/spec-001-user-signup.md
```

### 5. Implement the Code

```bash
/dev-story .workflow/specs/spec-001-user-signup.md
```

This uses the underlying `create-plans` skill to:
- Break spec into atomic tasks
- Execute implementation
- Run tests and verification
- Create git commits
- Generate SUMMARY.md

## Project Structure

When using Storyline, your project will follow this structure:

```
my-project/
├── .workflow/
│   ├── PRD.md                    # Original requirements
│   ├── epics/
│   │   ├── epic-001-auth.md
│   │   └── epic-002-tasks.md
│   ├── stories/
│   │   ├── story-001-signup.md
│   │   └── story-002-login.md
│   ├── specs/
│   │   ├── spec-001-signup.md
│   │   └── spec-002-login.md
│   └── .planning/                # Generated by create-plans
│       ├── BRIEF.md
│       ├── ROADMAP.md
│       └── phases/
│           └── 01-authentication/
│               ├── PLAN.md
│               └── SUMMARY.md
└── src/                          # Your actual code
```

## Commands Reference

### `/epic-creator <prd-file>`

Parse a PRD or technical spec into one or more epics.

**Input:** PRD markdown file
**Output:** Epic files in `.workflow/epics/`

**Options:**
- Single epic mode (small features)
- Multi-epic mode (large projects)

### `/story-creator <epic-file>`

Generate user stories from an epic.

**Input:** Epic markdown file
**Output:** Story files in `.workflow/stories/`

**Features:**
- Validates story format
- Ensures INVEST criteria
- Links back to parent epic

### `/spec-story <story-file>`

Create technical specification from a user story.

**Input:** Story markdown file
**Output:** Technical spec in `.workflow/specs/`

**Includes:**
- Architecture decisions
- File changes required
- Testing requirements
- Acceptance criteria

### `/dev-story <spec-file>`

Execute the technical spec and implement the code.

**Input:** Technical spec file
**Output:** Working code + SUMMARY.md

**Process:**
1. Converts spec to PLAN.md format
2. Invokes `create-plans` for execution
3. Breaks work into atomic tasks (2-3 per plan)
4. Executes with quality controls
5. Creates git commits
6. Generates summary linking back to story

## Example Workflow

See `examples/sample-workflow/` for a complete example with:
- Sample PRD
- Generated epics
- User stories
- Technical specs
- Implementation summaries

## Dependencies

Storyline is built on top of [taches-cc-resources](https://github.com/glittercowboy/taches-cc-resources) by glittercowboy.

**Required skills from taches:**
- `create-plans` - Hierarchical project planning and execution
- `create-agent-skills` - Skill creation framework
- `create-meta-prompts` - Staged workflow generation

## How It Works

Storyline uses Claude Code's **skill system** to create autonomous workflows:

1. **Skills** - Located in `~/.claude/skills/`, each skill is a router that loads appropriate workflows based on context
2. **Commands** - Slash commands in `~/.claude/commands/` that invoke skills with arguments
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Skills only load the reference files needed for the current workflow
4. **Quality Gates** - Built-in validation at each stage prevents garbage-in-garbage-out

Each skill follows the router pattern:
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Router + principles
├── workflows/            # Step-by-step procedures
├── references/           # Domain knowledge
└── templates/            # Output structures
```
